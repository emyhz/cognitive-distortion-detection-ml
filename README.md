# Cognitive Distortion Detection (Text Classification)

## Overview
This project detects cognitive distortions in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. Given an input sentence, the model predicts the most likely cognitive distortion category or whether a distortion is present.

Common cognitive distortions include:
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Emotional reasoning
- No distortion
- Magnification
- Fortune-telling
- Overgeneralization
- Mind reading
- Should statements
- Personalization
- Mental filtering
- Labeling

## Features
