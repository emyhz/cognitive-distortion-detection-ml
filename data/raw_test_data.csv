12,Hi I am a 21-year-old male student. Recently I smoked weed for second time in my life. I smoked more than what I smoked during my first time. I inhaled the smoked fully 6 times and then I started experiencing auditory hallucination like hearing people laugh when no one was there. Then I also heard song playing which was actually not playing. It got over after 2-3 hours. But now I am really scared that I might get schizophrenia in future. Because I have a family history of schizophrenia but not my parents and siblings but my cousin and his father. I got this fear because I read on internet that only those people predisposed to schizophrenia will experience these symptoms after smoking weed. And the weed was not mixed other substances. And I did not have any psychotic symptoms before that. Please response.,But now I am really scared that I might get schizophrenia in future.,7

1522,"Hi, I’m a 15 year old. I was abused and sexually assaulted when I was only 12. I had struggles with an eating disorder, depression, and anxiety through my junior high years. I do go to therapy, but I think there’s something else wrong with me. I have overcome my eating disorder as well as my depression, suicidal thoughts, and my anxiety is much better, but something I thought was normal was just brought to my attention to my therapist. I hear voices. Nobody else hears them apparently. They’ve got names and I can tell which one’s talking. Pan and Jacen talk the most, but there’s Kiri and Winter and others. They are not me and they have distinct voices. Sometimes I feel like I’m being followed and this makes my heart race. Sometimes when I swing or walk on the sidewalk I feel like someone’s going to shoot me or fire an arrow into my back. It’s dumb, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I see strange things that aren’t there. I used to see a dragon in the downstairs bathroom as a kid and sometimes my vision goes white or static is in front of all of it. My sense of time is also pretty bad and I usually don’t know what’s real. I listen to music a lot to ground myself and block out the voices. Pan is annoying, but Jacen is scary. He’s listening now and I can see him smiling and my heart is thudding. I’m scared to talk about this with my therapist because I’m scared of what she might tell me. Plus I think my parents are sick of me talking about my trauma and I don’t want to be a bother. Also, my mood shifts. Like sometimes I’m on top of the world and love everything and everyone and I’m ready to move out and be a doctor, but sometimes I want to die or I want to be ten years old and curl up in a ball and cry. I’m pretty high functioning, but I often feel unsafe walking down the crowded halls at school or at lunch. Sometimes I dissociate. I fade into my mind and I don’t remember anything except that when I’m brought back to reality, time has passed. I usually do this in crowded places. What should I do? Do I have schizophrenia or something else?","I’m scared to talk about this with my therapist because I’m scared of what she might tell me.

Many times he doesn’t remember tasks he completed days ago. We are at a stressful time in our relationship which includes the 6 month old baby. We used to be best friends and still today sometimes we enjoy time shared with the baby, but I see more and more he has no idea of what I’m referring to because he asks, “huh?” all the time.

There is another female who claims to have had a yearlong relationship with him that resulted in a baby! I believe her, and her child is two months older than mine. When I ask him he has no idea who the person is. I have even talked to the ex-girlfriend and one phone partner without his knowledge. He really thinks our relationship is fine.

2462,"My mother is obsessed with making up for being a “bad” mother. She paid very little attention to us as children. We essentially raised ourselves. Now she smothers us, calling several times a day, coming to visit 3-4 time per year (she lives in another state), and staying 10 days at a time. All of our interactions involve her trying to teach us the basics, as if we are still 5 year-olds, and demanding honor and respect simply for being the mother. Conversations a nearly impossible because she is always right about everything and we should simply accept and honor her wisdom, as the elder. I have tried to gently (and not so gently) remind her that we are now adults and do not need this type of guidance any longer, but she insists that it is a mothers job to teach her children all through life. She respects NO boundaries!I could write for days on that subject alone. She continually says things like the mother is the most important person in one’s life, etc…etc… I know her issues stem from having been sent away for her safety during a war, in her very young years, and then being reunited with her family several years later (resulting in two separation/abandonment scenarios). She also married and left her family behind to come to the US from her homeland when she was 26. This left her with no family support, except for her in-laws, which she claims treated her poorly. Lastly she is uneducated and lacked any motivation to change that. I pity her for all her hardships, but I hate her for what she’s become as a result. My brothers are strong enough to ignore her demands for attention, leaving me to console her and defend them.

2532,"I experienced three consecutive traumas during childhood — the first living alone with my severely depressed and volatile mother whose moods terrified me, the second a long period of violent sexual abuse culminating in my rape at age 9, the third a very open rejection and subsequent abandonment by my father. I’m now 23 and my life is beautiful. I have dealt with most of my issues. But one that won’t leave me alone is that I feel I am stuck with the emotional maturity of a small child. It’s like I stopped developing at some point. I cry literally every day, often at things that most people would find ridiculous. I have so many emotions and I don’t know what to do with them. I am so embarrassed because I frequently find myself fighting back tears in public. I’m not depressed, I am very happy in general, it’s just that my emotional responses are childlike and it only takes the tiniest thing to set me off. I’m constantly struggling not to cry like a silly little girl, I can’t seem to control myself. I can’t really describe the things that upset me, because they are so varied. Is this something I will have to live with forever? Is there a certain type of therapy that you could recommend? My last therapist told me that I was just an incredibly sensitive person and that I’d have to accept this about myself, but I can’t bear the thought of being so emotional forever. I don’t feel that it’s normal. Did my childhood trauma stunt my emotional development? Did I get stuck?

602,"From a teen in Malaysia: I don’t know whether I’m being paranoid or not, but I’d rather be safe than sorry. Since I was young (started around 10) I’ve been talking to people that aren’t there. I’ve never had any hallucination or delusions, I know what is real and what is not, and I can control whenever I talk to myself. I never do it in public, only behind closed doors. I don’t fully talk to myself, it’s more like I mumble. The strange thing I noticed is that most people with schizophrenia have fixed people in their heads and regular hallucinations. However, I can make the “people” I talk to in my head whoever I want them to be. The “people” I talk to are never fictionally created by me, they’re always people who actually exist in the world. I also tend to create scenarios in my head, and these can affect the conversations I have with myself.

I can talk to my dad whenever I want, but his wife (my step-mom) is very controlling an makes me want to avoid him. My grandfather was a child molester, though I don’t remember him ever molesting me. I DO remember him taking pictures of me naked, but nothing else. It didn’t seem to be very traumatic at all though. However I still have a sexual desire for boys around the age of 12 or 13 or so. A therapist I talked to (it wasn’t a full blown weekly thing,..I just talked to her three times, and that was it.) said that something happened at that age that stunted my sexual development, and now I am stuck at that age sexually. I agree with her conclusion because it would explain all my feelings such as my feeling that my body hair is unnatural and that it makes me feel dirty, and that people the same age as my body are intimidating to make friends with. 13 yr olds are much easier to make friends with for me as well.

172,"From the U.S.:  My husband started to work from home like a year ago, it was just a part-time job and not very consistent.It worked well at the beginning but slowly started to be an issue in our relationship. I work full-time and I guess I started to be jealous of his schedule, being able to be home, etc. Since he had so much time, he started to play computer games again (used to play them 24/7 as a teenager) which also included joining some online forums. In July I discovered that he was talking to multiple girls online (sexually and romantically) and that he joined forums such “looking for relationship” etc. He told me he had only talked to one girl (I saw conversations with multiple women) and only because she had mental issues. After that, he stopped talking to them online, yet still kept playing video games. He was supposed to find a new job since his PT job slowly stopped making him any money, yet he wasn’t able to (or didn’t even try) find one within the past 6-7months. He plays his computer games around 10 hours a day, goes to bed at 3-5am pretty much every day, spends money (that I’m trying to save) on his games and ignores everything around the house. Whenever I try to confront him about something he gets very upset, calls me names like “b*tch” “idiot” and just yells at me. Whenever I find out he lied to me about something it’s the same – starts to yell at me, starts to throw things, hit himself, calls me names and sometimes blames it on me. Then he always apologizes and tells me how much he loves me and that I’m his everything. Now he is supposed to go back to school starting in two weeks, but every time I asked him to show me his log in, schedule or just something, he gets upset and his log in magically doesn’t work.I looked at his school email and saw many emails from his school counselors telling him that he was late to sign up and can only sign up for summer semester at this point.

1103,"I’ve known this for about 13 years. I am 30 years old now. I had a brief (few months) relation with a boy 12 years ago that was ended and then confessed to the parents of the child. Since then, over the years, there have been recurrant thoughts and indulgence in certain types of media and, for a short time, online chatting. This has all stopped, and I am in therapy now (having revealed all of the above to the therapist, who informed me of her legal obligations and professional concern…everything addressed as it should be), of my own volition. I have also brought this up to my circle of friends, and thereby lost most of them. My life is very difficult right now, but I’ve so far been able to keep myself from the old habits and look into ways of changing. What I’m glad about is that I’m doing this without being forced to. As thrilling as it was to have a dirty secret, it’s worthwhile for me to not feel like I’m hunted and a monster. I’m glad that, even though technically, I could be jailed for whatI’ve done, I have brought this into the light without getting caught and thrown away. I’ m doing this, not because and the state says I must, but because I say I must. I’m glad that some people have been very understanding and supportive. I am still loved. What worries me are three main concerns: Firstly, I wonder about myself. There were times in the past when I decided to give it up, but I started looking at stuff again (the almost-entire majority of this thing was looking at pics/vids) and then that would continue for a while. I know I have to change. It’s either move forward on the path I’m on, or end up perpetuating a cycle that thrives on the exploitation of those who don’t comprehend exactly how they’re being used. It seems like many things in my life…many grand ideas…get left behind like forgotten toys. I don’t want that to happen with this. I’ve heard of the recidivism rate of offenders and it’s a bit daunting. My prime hope is the theraputic process.

1766,"I think I may have DP. My world feels very surreal. I feel “detached” from my body. I want people to see me as my mind and not my body. It’s almost as if my body is a puppet and my mind is the puppet master. Everyone sees and love the puppet but no one truly knows the one controlling it. And my body feels “fake” to me, as if it’s not truly my own body. I hardly even can recognize myself in the mirror and will sometimes avoid mirrors for this reason. I will have moments where I’m dragged out of my surreal state. Some are random, some have a cause. The times that are random if feels as if I have been flying my whole life and for but a moment I touch my feet to the earth and feel trapped. The light seems new, the people I thought I new seem like strangers. I have kind of “hypersensitivity” to the world and all motions feel strange. The things I had just been doing feel like a distant memory. This happens randomly. Sometimes I can be forcefully dragged out of my surreal state, usually by comments about my body or actions. I feel like a stranger to myself with a sudden awareness that people only see my body and my actions but they don’t truly see me, they never can see who I really am. The things I do and say seem foreign to me when I get a moment to think about it. It’s like I don’t even truly know who I am. I’m known to think I have various disorders when I don’t really so this makes me hesitate to say I have DP, though unlike times when I thought I had something like schizoid and I’d create the symptoms after learning about it, I had the symptoms previous to knowing what DP was and in fact was how I found out about DP. I don’t fit every symptom but some I do match up with. The feelings are rather mild and are more of an afterthought most of the time.",,2

587,"I have been seeing a psychiatrist for what seem to be mood issues, like depression, but keep reacting poorly to meds (antidepressants and a mood stabilizer) and my doctor said I seemed to have a reaction like I was bipolar (mixed episode), but don’t meet the criteria for bipolar in general. Like I got way more suicidal on both, not just the antidepressant. I feel like I am often mentally healthy, then have these bad depressive episodes, or just these mental breakdowns and get self-destructive and feel like I fall down a rabbit hole. It seems stranger than just depression, but it’s not really my baseline and it is like a weird spiraling effect. It lasts longer than just a reaction to a specific event, so seems to be mood related. My doctor keeps saying my reactions are unusual, and is trying his best to help, but it’s like none of us know what is going on. Therapy seems like a good option, and I tried CBT, but when I feel this bad I cannot even concentrate on what is going on. I am sure I can eventually pull myself out of it this time, but it seems like it will keep happening and it’s weird to be so lost in my mind and no one understands or can help me. I know you cannot diagnose me, but I guess my question is, do people sometimes not fit any category and are just really not typical and nothing really can help? I don’t mean I cannot do anything for my mental health, but that I will have to do it alone, without professional help?","I feel like I am often mentally healthy, then have these bad depressive episodes, or just these mental breakdowns and get self-destructive and feel like I fall down a rabbit hole.",0
1576,"I was deceived by a married man for 2 years.

We kept in touch, and always talked about getting back together. One day I was searching on the internet and I found his wife’s Myspace page from the looks of it she wasn’t in Germany and never had been it talked about living here with her wonderful husband and that they were planning on having another baby this year. I did more digging and found a mound of evidence that she was here the whole time and not only that I believe there were other woman he was with as well. I’m so devastated how could I be so stupid for over two years? I was and am despite everything still so in love with him we are no longer talking but how do you make love just go away it may have been a lie to him but it was real to me. I almost don’t want to be alive anymore I just can’t get over the lies and deceit. Honesty is so important to me and he knew that. How do I move past this and stop obsessing?

1142,"Is there a list available of character traits, habits and/or actions which would indicate in a general sense a psychological issue? ie: The person never shows embarrassment. The person hoards candy in the dresser drawers, under the bed, etc. The person is moody: sometimes depressed, angry, sulks or broods. The person never accepts responsibility or blame for wrongdoing but always blames others for whatever happens. If a glass is knocked over and spills or breaks, “it fell”. The person is slightly dyslexic, especially with numbers. Once the idea for a specific item wanted is in mind, that item will be had, no matter how much time elapses; it is not forgotten. The person does not tell jokes and rarely laughs at the humor of others. Most often the person does not understand the punchline of a joke. The person often acts as a victim. ie: purchases the wrong product because the correct one was out of stock, will be nearly driven off the road because will not use the horn, etc. In speech the person often attaches 2 totally/nearly unrelated phrases together using the word “but”. There is nothing perfect; there is something wrong/negative in everything/everyone. Nearly always there is some minor ailment: a pain here, ache there, headache, bellyache, blurry vision, etc., seemingly in contrast/competition to others who are experiencing serious medical conditions ie: hip replacement, cancer, etc. The person does not seem to understand limiting physical teasing such as pinching by saying,”That didn’t hurt.” or “I barely touched you.” The person wants everyone to recognize and be generous at birthday and other special times of giving but is not generous personally. Gifts are often not age related/appropriate such as giving a small child-sized gift to an older adolescent or teenager. The person prefers to use the walk-in bank lobby vs the drive thru because it “makes them feel important.” The person is not a deep thinker, does not have plans for nor talks about desires for the future. The person does not stay on task well and seems to be easily distracted from the task at hand. The aforementioned are quirks to the negative. The person has many positive characteristics as well, however, that is for another discussion. Thanks.

731,"I’ve been known to help out friends and loved ones that are going through their own trials and tribulations, and I genuinely do love doing this because I know its the right thing to do and it makes me happy to see them find the light at the end of the tunnel per say. But as the years go by I’ve noticed that the same people I’ve helped out seem to either leave me in the dust or I get the feeling they weren’t actually appreciative of me helping them out. Don’t get me wrong, I get that I’m not gonna be the only important thing in their lives but it still really hurts me for them to just drop me off like that when considering the countless hours I’ve spent with them assisting them through their own dilemmas and stretching my olive branch as far as I possibly can. But even then sometimes they would outright ignore my advice or spit it back in my face, only for them to get hurt because they didn’t listen to my advice and by the end of it they come back saying I was right only for them to do the same exact thing and continue their own vicious cycle and it pained me deeply to see them that way. I can even think of moments where one of them would leave me in the dark while vaguely communicating with me leading me to get frustrated and anxious over what in gods name they’d be doing only for them to be completely fine by the end of it. It’s terrible. Plus, every time I’ve tried to get in contact with some of these people now they seem to blow me off as if I never said hello. As a result, I feel hurt, I don’t always think about them but when I do it feels like a dagger in my heart. I feel like I maybe shouldn’t have tried to assist them and maybe I wouldn’t feel like the way I do now.

Drawing is one of the only things I can do where my head isn’t a buzz with disaster scenariorizing. It’s nice to be calm, but after a while I start to wonder if constantly turning to something like this might not be healthy. Even if I’m being distracted from my current problems, I’m not really coming to any kind of resolution with them. And ignoring the problem feels like it could only make things worse.

We are a good family, I am my parents only child and 3 years ago we have moved countries, from Brazil to the United States. For the past 5 years, me and my dad have questioned if she has any type of mental disorder. She is very stubborn, violent when mad, and very easily irritated. Her mood changes incredibly easy, for example today- which was the last drop for me- After my last few days of school, I came home early to study for an important exam tomorrow, however as I know she feels lonely I decided to stay with her for a few hours. We had great three hours together, laughing and talking. Finally, I need to leave and she asks me to drive her somewhere close, “Just wait for me to get ready”. I should mention she had to be with friends in few minutes and, she constantly complains she is lonely so I did my best to insist she’d go. Once I walk into her room 20 minutes after, she is laying in her bed, practically naked on her phone ( that is another issue, my mother is completely addicted to her phone and she blames me and my father for excluding her for so long she has to stay on her phone).

We used to talk on the phone every night and now we only talk on the phone a few times per week.

1974,"I’m a sixteen year old female, and I grew up with an abusive mother. She has bipolar and narcissistic personality disorder, and I was often the one she projected her negative emotions onto. Social isolation was always, always my punishment, and about two years ago I was forced to stay in my room for six months, only allowed to come out to go to school or use the bathroom. My aunt has recently brought my attention to the fact that I show symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder, and I’ve taken many online tests that say I’m extremely likely to have borderline or be somewhere on the schizophrenic spectrum. I get very mad very quickly, and i can’t control my anger. When I was little I would bite the back of my hand hard enough to draw blood out of anger. I choked my baby sister once because I was so angry that she wouldn’t stop crying, and I’ve had to do community service for assault by contact. when I’m walking home from school, I feel like every car that passes is going to kidnap me and murder or hurt me. I can’t sleep with my door shut at night because I’m terrified someone or something is in my room, in my closet or hiding under my bed. I can’t sleep if the door is unlocked, and I have empty soda bottles along my window sill to let me know if someone breaks in. I have to have a nightlight so I can see every corner of my room to be sure no one is there. I also do this thing, where I literally pretend to be someone else entirely. My aunt says this is called dissociation, but I’m not sure that’s what it is. I don’t feel disconnected from my body when I do it, I just pretend I’m not me. i switch into someone else, but I’m still aware of everything around me. It’s hard to explain. I smoke, I drink occasionally, and I have two tattoos. I’ll also copy the personalities of my best friends, and I’ll do pretty much anything to fit in with my peers. I’m not sure if something is wrong or not, but I decided to ask because my situation at home won’t allow me to go to a doctor. Sorry the question is so long. Thank you.",,2

2369,"I’ve become very concerned for my friend over the past few months, and even more so as recently I went through her notes on her phone when she let me borrow it to text my parents. First off, I’d noticed that she’d lost quite a bit of weight since winter break, at least 15-20 pounds off an already slender frame. It wasn’t just the weight, she hasn’t eaten lunch at school these past months either, and whenever we eat out somewhere on the weekends she hardly touches her plate even though she only orders a salad. Also, she always quickly types on her phone before eating — this is what compelled me to go on her notes, just to see if there was anything, and there was. She has a folder documenting her height and weights, morning and evening, with exact times, from the past 6 months; 5’4″ she started at 120lbs and is now down to 105lbs She also has weights labeled GW and UGW- 100 and 97, respectively. She has a folder in which she’s typed up rules for herself varying from “consume 200-800 calories daily” and “fast once a week”, to “exercise 30- 90 minutes 6X/week”. Also she has one labeled food journal but I didn’t get to look at it because I didn’t want to arouse suspicion for taking too long. Seeing this has shocked me, and since then I’ve been paying closer attention to her, and there’s something else that I find alarming, although I’m not sure what exactly it means. I glanced at her hands last week and saw that not only are her fingernails chewed, the skin around her cuticles and knuckles is torn up and bloodied in some areas. I’ve realized that she’ll pick at the skin and sometimes even bite it- the nails AND skin. I’ve never seen anything like this. I am fairly certain she has an eating disorder, but what is this other biting thing and why? It looks very painful. I feel like I need to tell someone about these things, like her parents or the nurse, but I don’t want to lose her as a friend, I love her and I don’t want her to hate me for betraying her trust, especially if she realizes I went through her phone. How can I help her without damaging our friendship? (age 18, from US)",,2

When i sit by myself thinking anything other than school, I like to think of anything that has made me feel like a bad person. I have to drown it out with music or podcasts to drown out my thoughts. I have trouble sleeping during the night without videos. I used to cry to make me feel better but sense being deemed a cry baby by other and myself, I stopped. I barely smile, but when I do its fake. I fake laugh more. My friends don’t treat me like another person, casting me aside for others.

One of the main problems is a constant urge and desire to have some sort of serious mental health disorder, and I mean disorders from Schizophrenia to Dissociative Identity Disorder, and I can understand how absolutely horrible that sounds. My mind never seems to drift away from over-analyzing any small part of my day that may be related to some sort of symptom of a disorder (such as overreacting to any thoughts that don’t seem to be mine kind of thing). I have already researched different disorders out of curiosity and know about different symptoms, I don’t believe I am a hypochondriac. I am currently seeing someone about a possible Anxiety Disorder and I believe I am showing some early symptoms of a Dissociative Disorder and some form of Psychosis, but I can’t help but worry about NOT being diagnosed with a disorder. Most nights I have imagined myself in a mental hospital when I am older or developing some sort of alternate personalities, the idea of someone experiencing these fascinate me, one recent dream of mine I remember was the exact life of me living with DID but I can’t remember it exactly. I have also been on edge more than normal, I have flinched a shuddered to noises constantly struggling to reassure myself if the noises were real, I have also experienced Depersonalisation for at least 2-3 years which has started to mix with Derealisation which has also kept me on edge.

Growing up I didn’t have very many friends, and the ones I did have emotionally abused me in the relationship from 3rd grade all the way up to 6th grade. My father was very emotionally neglectful and never gave me his approval. When I was 9 years old I had my first dream of killing someone, but I don’t remember the dream as a negative, I remember being more fascinated. Theses dream accrued now and again through the passing years. I have been also diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety.

And somebody can only screw me over If I let them, by either trusting them or letting down my guard.

If I don’t destroy them in that instant, I will keep my enemy close until I have everything I need to bring him all the way down to nothing.

I feel disconnected with my emotions and they are more something I use to fit in. Around 6th grade, I learned that retaining appearance was very important to my future with relationships.

878,"My best friend had a terrible car accident 4 months ago with serious brain damage and head injuries, all the doctors said he would not make it, they said they are only waiting for him to die or stay in coma, and that there is nothing left to do. At that time i was absolutely devastated and had a really hard time. He was in a coma for about a month, however after a few successful surgeries he started waking up, and against all odds he survived. Injuries he suffered were great, but now, after 4 months, he is slowly recovering, he learned how to walk again, he recognizes his family and me, his long-term memory is more or less ok. However, his short-term memory is pretty bad, and because of the accident he cant open his eyes, and it is not sure whether he will be able to see again in his life. We are best friends from college, I live in Slovakia, he lives in Czech republic, so we were able to see each other only when in school, but we were always together, whether in school or when we were going out to bars etc. He is recovering in Czech republic, I am currently living in Slovakia, so I cannot see him that often. The problem is, i thought i got use to the fact that he is no longer going to school with me and that I am not seeing him regularly. However, he likes to talk on the phone (of course he is confused some times), and whenever his family calls me and I talk to them and to him, I start to shiver, shake, suddenly I am feeling cold and it takes my body about half an hour to relax. This is nothing serious, but I thought I am over the anxiety of him being hurt or dying, he is recovering and with each day he is getting better.

This particular time in 1960 after she left his father felt he couldn’t cope with the children, and hoping to make his wife return, he put them into care. Apparently they were in care a while, as it was hard to get them out back then once put into care. My mum told me that he never really forgave his parents for doing this and even though he had a relationship with them. He blamed his dad for a long time, but after his dad’s death, realized that his dad had only acted this way in order to try to get his mum back.

1961,"Need help dealing with high conflict ex-wife of boyfriend. They share custody of 3 teens; divorced 7 years. He let her stay in his house while between apartments after getting evicted, but then stayed 8 months longer while all the kids lived there and she continued to collect child support and stay overnight with her new bf. She has bad credit and dogs so this was her excuse for not being able to find a home. When he insisted that she leave she got angry and left her dogs behind. This is the second set of dogs she has abandoned and one set has lived with my bf for 7 years now. He refuses to keep another two dogs and has told her she must take them. Her solution was to take them to the shelter with his 14 year old son, telling him his father was forcing her to do it, that his father is selfish for not letting her leave the dogs “for just another few weeks.” My bf’s son, who is a “young” 14, is sad and angry at his father, which is typical of these scenarios. This isn’t, as you might imagine, just about the dogs – boundaries that are enforced are punished through the kids. I encourage him to keep strong boundaries and he does increasingly so. In the big picture, I think it is the right thing to do for him and his children, but the stress of these constant “punishments” is making him physically sick. He spent years bending over backwards so as to keep some kind of relationship with his children, but they are older now (and he is late 50s and exhausted) and is really trying to change the dynamic. Yesterday, she stole his EZ pass out of his car and had her oldest daughter text him that they needed to go on a college visit (note that she already receives 40k a year post tax for the kids, works part time, so desperate for $ is kooky). I would call the police for even small infractions to make a point, but my bf knows only his kids will suffer and he just can’t stand to watch. The kids cling to “mommy” and crave her affection — the more inconsistent she is the more they cling. Sad. Any advice? Help.",,2

We broke up because he had to leave Florida for a job in Chicago after college and I was told that’s the only reason. Our relationship was going good and we both really liked each other but apparently he liked the thought of the job and his potential life in Chicago more or maybe he felt it was just something he had to do. 2 months before he had to move away he broke up with me because he realized he was probably going to move away and he didn’t want to hurt me anymore than he had to and thought it’d be smart to end it earlier than later. I freaked out and basically lost my mind and was beyond depressed until we got back together. He texted me telling me he missed me and we got back together until right before he had to move. Ever since he moved and away and we broke up I’ve been severely depressed and even felt suicidal at times. I basically just feel like my whole life has been taken away and I can’t stop thinking about him. I literally think about him 24/7 and feel an unbearable pain every time I think about him and it’s just too much.

I still think about him first thing when I wake up and last thing before I go to bed and I don’t know why I’m so obsessed with him. He was just an average looking (to most people) very nice normal guy that was going to college and as soon as I met him I instantly fell in love.

About a year ago his friend stayed over at our house while we were out on vacation, I’ve never met his friend before and only said yes because he said his friend was trustworthy. His friend ended up bringing over a female coworker and not letting us know but I found an eyeliner so I was upset and asked my boyfriend to talk to him since he didn’t want me to talk to his friend myself.

I got upset and ended up leaving early because I was so mad and didn’t want to make a scene with someone I barely knew. Before I left I told my boyfriend he needed to talk to him because his friend disrespected me and made me wonder why he would call me someone’s name who was in my boyfriend’s life over 4 years ago. He said he talked to him and told him to apologize to me so his friend tried to add me on Instagram to apologize. I want nothing to do with his friend and I’m upset that all my boyfriend did was have a talk with his friend that I made him have and then went on to act like nothing happened.

1707,"I’ve been happily single-by-choice for many years. Definitely not even considering ANY possibility of new “romantic” relationship. Out of NOWHERE, I started constantly thinking about & plotting ways to spend time with a man approx 15 yrs younger than I. He works evenings & nights as a security guard where I reside. He’s been working here for approx. 6 mos. I’d seen & even spoken briefly to him several times previously, but without a hint of warning I became “closer” (no physical exchanges due to my faith & beliefs). Here’s the kicker: he couldn’t be FURTHER from what has always been my “type”. Where I live there are many different nationalities & people from many diverse ethnic backgrounds. I’ve always been attracted first & foremost, by physical appearance & to races other than mine (Caucasian). This “young man” is Hispanic, having only arrived in Hawaii last year, and is pure WHITE, skinny, shaved head, big ears & a horrible physique. Now’s the time to add the fact of my extremely good, rare physical shape-not only for “my age” but for women in general. I’ve had 5 large babies but have always been very athletic-serious weight-lifting for many years as well as running, canoe-paddling etc. In 2009 I realized my 35-year dream & underwent an abdominoplasty which removed 2 lbs. of loose skin only-no liposuction needed-& complete abdominal muscle restoration (stretch marks & scars are history & I’ve had extensive tattooing over the surgical scars. People think I’m “fibbing” when they learn about my large family because my body definitely is not the “norm” in the many-children dept. I’m 5′ 2″, still somewhat muscular, have long, straight hair (in which I keep all traces of white from becoming obvious) & am feisty & energetic. I’m certainly not movie-star gorgeous but not too shabby for 61* So…what is up with my totally out-of-character attraction to this guy? He has a beautiful accent I call “Sprench” for Spanish/French because it sounds like a little of both. He’s been very kind & considerate but I think I’ve frightened him with my hyper, “dog-with-a-bone” personality. He’s separated from his wife, who’s in CA. I mean, if my kids ever knew about this they’d think I’d totally lost it. I have 2 bodybuilder sons & all my children are super attractive, as are their kids.

I also dress up little different, so every one first thought is that this girl is weird. I have had 5 friend in my life and now just left two. others grew up like normal kids so I became too weird for them. even when I was in first grades in school teachers were forcing others to talk with me because when other were playing I was just drawing, not even paying attention. I’m not even going to mention my obsessions, weird talks about subjects that no one cares about. everyone was calling me philosopher. I also could never consider someone’s eyes I just improved that a year ago. also, I show many other symptoms except maybe not understanding what are people telling me. sometimes my grandma and mum tell me that I’m like a brick not understanding what people tell me but I don’t really know why are they saying it. this is my suspicion about Asperger, but what I really worry about is delusions. when I was 14 or so I was convinced that I am a werewolf even though I don’t believe in them. I believed it so much I would do stupid things like I would eat raw meat (which is funny because I don’t like meat), having dreams about me shapeshifting and if I would discover little scratch next morning it was because it really happened.

After a few months I started to enjoy watching men masturbate to me masturbating, something about it would absolutely turn me on like crazy. Now as time has passed I find myself curious to find a masturbating friend, but I am not attracted to men. Like the thought of me and another man just pleasuring each other with our hands turns me on but I just don’t get turned on by man. I love women inside and out from head to toe. Any idea what I’m going thru? Could it be a phase or just a random fantasy? Please help and thanks!",,2
2158,"I’ve been on antidepressants since I was six, and now I’m 15. Everything’s confusing me, and I don’t feel like I’m worthy of the title of depressed because I’m not showing things outwardly, except I’m starting to and I don’t know if it’s because I want attention or for some other reason. I always want attention from adults – I want them to listen to me without being paid, and I want them to at least act like they care. I know that I’m depressed, but my school counselor is all too eager to report anything I say to my mother (I’m not interested in self-harm but she thinks I am) and my therapist isn’t too helpful. My mom and twin brother are both depressed as well, and my mom tells me that I weigh too much, that I’m depressed because I watch crime shows, and that all my problems are insignificant compared to hers. My brother is skipping school, on the path to failing the tenth grade just like he failed ninth grade, and I’m scared my dad will sue for custody if my brother fails tenth grade. I don’t like to use official words (depression, abuse, anxiety, disorder, etc) because I’m scared that I’m not worthy of them, I almost feel like they’re titles that I don’t deserve because I don’t act the right way. I spend most of my time in school trying to keep from attacking people, because I honestly don’t know if I would or not if I had the chance. I try to keep my grades up, but everything is falling apart around me and nobody seems to care. Or maybe they do and just don’t know how to deal with me, I’m not sure. They laugh when I try to do things to distract myself, because I don’t want to be in my own head. They laugh that I spend my time searching up universities in other countries because I want to get far, far away from here. Even the school counselor laughs at me, and I feel like I’m not worth saying that I have problems. What am I supposed to do with my depression and why is everything suddenly getting so much worse?

1489,"My boyfriend has a school reunion event coming up next weekend. I’m not going because I didn’t go to his school. I grew up in another country and moved to the UK when I was 18, and met my bf soon after I moved to the uk. I felt very daunted by being with him as he was very popular at school and he still lived in the environment where all his school friends were and where he grew up, while I didn’t know a single person in the country. However, I have always been someone that makes friends easily, I never have any issue with anyone and generally I would say I’m pleasant person. But for some reason some of his school friends were not welcoming to me. perhaps I was seen as an outsider, (I’m European), or as someone a bit different. but me and him are very happy together. Over the years I’ve heard from some of his friends that they had “heard I was a horrible person and heard bad things about me from other people”, and the people were always people I’d never met, and it was just girls or bitchy people that my bf went to school with. I never understood it, but it really did hurt my feelings because as I said before I’m an open-minded and friendly person, and don’t think I’ve experienced people just randomly saying horrible things about me behind my back. we have a great friendship group with lots of his and my friends, and we all get on really well. however, I’m surprised and hurt that he would go to this event next weekend considering there will be people there that clearly have some strange vendetta against me that I can’t explain, nor do I know where it stems from. he says it shouldn’t matter to me, but it does.this is a big deal for me and I’m surprised he would walk over me like this. should I be hurt or just accept that he wants to go to this school reunion? he sees his friends all the time, so it’s not really a “reunion”. thank you (From the UK)","however, I’m surprised and hurt that he would go to this event next weekend considering there will be people there that clearly have some strange vendetta against me that I can’t explain, nor do I know where it stems from. he says it shouldn’t matter to me, but it does.this is a big deal for me and I’m surprised he would walk over me like this",3

At first I didn’t mind it too much and I thought they were like Daymares, like Daydreams but they turn Terrifying. I imagine people getting murdered, mishaps, accidents, and I can’t stop it. Like, I walk passed one of my Friends and I may see a faint outline of a Pole sticking out of the back of their Head. I know it’s not really there, but I can’t help but think about “What if?”. I also get Nightmares about me trying to strangle my Friends. I can’t really control my Dreams and Nightmares, they just come randomly. I know I won’t ever do it, it’s just the back of my Head making me think those things. I can control myself, I know I can. But, when I start to think about normal things like “Did I eat Today?” Or “Maybe I should take a Bath”, my thoughts turn on me and I end up thinking of Forks getting Jabbed through the pallet and into the Skull and Drowning in the Tub.

I’ve been able to function fine, I know I’m existing and I’m able to talk to my friends and family with no trouble (besides arguing with my family constantly) but along with this feeling of not being all there I’ve had this fear that I may be schizophrenic. It started when I was smoking pot all the time, it was all fun and games until I had a little too much and I had a panic attack. I had no idea what was going on, but it passed. A few months passed and the depersonalization got worse, I developed anxiety after that panic attack and I began to have horrific thoughts that randomly invaded my mind and as much as I tried to get rid of them they wouldn’t go away. There was a point where I was scared to be alone and scared of my own thoughts that involved hurting my family which I know I would never do, and I didn’t know what to do anymore so I let the thoughts happen. They passed and t here was a point of clarity, but I still felt like I wasn’t all there.I thought I had a ruptured aneurism due to headaches I was having on a daily basis, there was even a point where I went to the emergency room cause I thought I had a brain tumor. I’m constantly looking into symptoms, I believe I have some of the ones listed. I’ve never had hallucinations besides this one time where I was buzzed and thought I saw a woman in a parked car and freaked out but it turned out to be the head rest, and I’ve never heard anything crazy besides people calling my name time to time and me thinking my friend was talking to me when she actually wasn’t. I’ve also been told I’m overly sensitive, and there are times where I have irrational thoughts or make scenarios up in my head that get me angry but I know they aren’t real in the end.

I didn’t have any activities in my leisure time, or any other responsibilities where I could have developed any other skills. I am disgusted by the way I look.

After awhile we were talking about the way we were imagining a creature that had the head of a guy from the Russian Sleep Experiment and the body of the creepypasta ‘The Rake’. After that we really started to get freaked out. We closed our eyes so we didn’t look out the windows anymore, and we started to imagine it staring at us. I could almost feel it watching me. We both stopped talking and it continued to stare at me, but eventually it was just gone and I was in my idea of a ‘perfect room’.

Finally I couldn’t talk anymore, I couldn’t breathe. My hands felt numb and my arms were shaking. Awhile later I was conscious of my surroundings again and I could feel my mouth, I couldn’t move it open. I ran my hands over it and the thread was gone, and my lips were unharmed. I could still feel the pain and a tingling sensation in my ribs. My friend said she experienced something similar to this. (We both have depression and anxiety problems).

1855,"When my children were young, there was an incident involving a dog attack. They had run ahead of me and stopped at the next street corner (daily game we played). An adult rottweiler came from behind a nearby bush and started to attack them. I meant to intercede, to yell, to block its advance. Instead, I felt the yell come out as a snarl, my fingers curled, I know I bared my teeth – instead of blocking the dog, I flanked and literally attacked it. (This bothered me afterwards – I felt I should have gotten in front of it. Since then, I have seen many videos where mother animals perform the same maneuver.) The dog fled. I ushered the kids home and sat quietly, waiting for my “self” to return. It was at least a half hour or more before I could really speak again. When I recall the instance, I still feel my “hackles” rise. My question: does “the animal with us all” exist? Is there any literature on this to which you could refer me? I’m sorry to bother anyone with this; I haven’t been able to find anything on my own, and it is an experience I’ll never forget. It really felt as if an animal had surfaced within me.",It really felt as if an animal had surfaced within me.,1
1813,"My mother has lived with me for years since she is regularly unemployed. Whenever I moved during the last 16 years, she usually followed. In the last 4 years, she has become paranoid–someone is stealing electricity, wifi, cable, cell phone service, water. We didn’t even have wifi or cable at the time. I even checked the water and electric usage, but found they were consistent with usage at other addresses. Then she decided someone must be at home at all times because someone is sneaking into the apartment–to mistreat our pets, to fiddle with the electricity, to steal services, to live in the attic. She also claims someone had wired the apartment to listen to us, wired the front door so it would randomly open, stole our forks (I don’t know where they went), stole the Mummy dvd (we have at least 100 dvds, but that one was the only one taken, sneaks through the ventilation, stops by and electrocutes her around 3 a.m. on random mornings, and added wires under the driver side of my car (don’t worry she pulled out). Someone disrupts the signal on her analog radio, she insists all power, circuit breakers be off, and the major appliances unplugged except for the refrigerator and a few lamps. She says her last 5 cell phones were hacked and taken over by someone. I have never experienced or witnessed any of the problems she claims. So she accuses me of helping the someone because I say none of these issues can be proven. She won’t see a doctor, and she can pass any mental test. Honestly, I wander if she is a dick rather than sick. These incidents have been continual at 3 dif ferent addresses. In the one address, the landlord said she could not live there any more because she was entering the basement and changing the handyman’s repairs. (I don’t know if this accusation is true; she denies it.) At one point nearly 2 years ago, I expressly asked her not to destroy the landlord’s county letter because it itemized repairs to the house. She ignored my request and ripped up the documents. I gave her $4000 (my savings) and my car and kicked her out of my apartment two years ago, so she stayed with my aunt for a week, in hotels for about a month. Then she came back for another $2000 (payday loans). Eventually, she spoke with the VA hospital, received a bed at a homeless shelter, and money to return to school. They also offered to pay for housing, but she couldn’t find a place she was comfortable with for the money offered. After a few months in the shelter, she “couldn’t” make it to the shelter by curfew, so she was kicked out and moved in with me again. Within a year, we moved again. About 8 months ago, we were evicted from a house (only 5 months into a year lease) because “someone” had cut out all the copper connecter in the electrical outlets (a fire hazard), had cut a large outdoor cord connecting the central air to the house, and had removed insulation and created holes in the outer walls. I cannot prove it was my mom, but no one else was in the house. She or I am always home. Now we’re in an apartment and she opens the outlets and has cut the connectors to the phone jacks. She still experiences are all of the aforementioned issues. I discovered she had pulled wires beneath the driver’s seat of my 8 month old car. She claims someone is hacking into its system. I plan to move because of unrelated issues, but because of my mom, I am hesitating. I am sick of the problems. I am sick of her refusing to listen to reason. I told her 5 months ago that I wanted to go separate ways with this move. I tried to give her time to find an apartment, get a job, request government assistance (she hasn’t worked since 2010), but she has proven she unwilling to take care of herself. She wants me to buy her a Winnebago, so she can live in the woods with her dog and cat. I am tempted because I don’t want to continue this cycle anymore. I don’t want her to live with me. I don’t even want her to know where I live. I don’t even feel guilty about it any more because every time I find something she “fixed” I just cry.

He has tried to leave her multiple times throughout their relationship, but she would threaten suicide in order to keep him around. A little bit about her: she suffers from childhood trauma. She had a very rough life growing up before she was adopted into my family. There is a history of schizophrenia, depression, and autism in her biological family tree. She is unreliable when it comes to committing to plans. She used to sleep all day, before the baby. She is never happy and if you make any mistakes, she will hold a grudge forever. She expects perfection from others, but will have excuses for herself. Since the age of twelve she has always had a boyfriend, I think her greatest fear is being single or alone. She is always angry or upset with him but will not let him go. A little bit about him: he is 3 years younger than her, he wants to be a twenty-something year old and hates being restricted by her. He has ADHD and chronic migraines, as well as a dysfunctional family. He has gotten to the point where he tries to reach out to other girls, or he tries to escape with friends. She goes through his phone every day AND SEES THAT HE IS TRYING TO CHEAT ON HER but will still not let him go. He has stopped doing household chores, he no longer helps take care of their child, he is trying to escape. If he is ever alone with the baby he tries to get others to watch her for him. He is always reaching out to me telling me how he does not love her, and how he wants to leave. I do not respond, but I predict that if he manages to leave, she will follow him. Or he is just venting to me and actually will not try to leave (because he’s done that before). They are currently looking for a new place to move in to.

33,"My brother’s always been a shy child, but he had a good relationship with family and friends. In his teenage years, he started to withdraw. I was the only one to whom he kept talking. He began to spend most of the day in his bedroom. He also began to use monosyllable words to reply to my parents, aunts, cousins… Never started a conversation unless you addressed him. Now, at 19 (almost 20), it has evolved to the point he doesn’t talk to anybody, not even to me, and not even with monosyllables. He doesn’t look anybody in the face either (he didn’t do that a few years ago). If I try to talk to him, he ignores me or makes a sound of annoyance and kicks me out of his bedroom. He is very childish too, in the sense that it is part of his routine to watch cartoons with his favorite stuffed toys (he refuses to throw toys away). He prefers their company to that of people. I don’t even know if he has friends. He certainly avoids his college peers. He has dinner alone and goes to sleep early (I bet it is only to avoid us too). He only goes out if he needs to get a book in the library or if he has to go to college. Otherwise, you’ll find him home. Is he afraid to become an adult? Could that be the reason he behaves like a child despite being almost 20? Could he have social anxiety? Autism, even? Maybe Aspergers. Some symptoms coincide: • Difficulty to socialize and make friends; isolation • Rigid routines (he gets distressed if he can’t follow them) • Fear of change (he doesn’t want to throw old/broken things away) • Hygiene issues (he rarely showers and shaves and he never uses deodorant) • Sensitivity to noises and light • Repetitive motor mannerisms (which he didn’t have as a child) If he had autism, though, he would have some speech difficulties, wouldn’t he? He actually uses sarcasm and understands it perfectly. Never shown any speech delay either. Besides, I think I read someone is born autistic, so he can’t become autistic at the age of 18. It’s been an evolution, that’s why I’m not sure what is going on. Is he just a very immature teenager or does he have a condition? (From Spain)",,2
637,"I would not consider this an “issue.” However I am curious to understand the potential reasoning’s behind this. Usually I spend a great majority of my free time in solitude, I don’t bother having social interactions with others (family or acquaintances) because quite frankly it is not enjoyable or particularly interesting. As far as intimacy goes I absolutely disdain love and affection. My childhood was great, and I do not have any family issues currently or from the past. I simply find that love and affection disgusts me. I realized that when I was 12, my mother would shower me with love and it would completely irritate me and grind my gears. She knows now that I do not like that so she stopped. The issue however, is my lack of any emotion and care for others. I am an introvert, but most introverts have some kind of social interactions with close friends or acquaintances. I however don’t have friends since most people cant meet my expectations and when I am friendly to someone they associate that with interest and they start to become annoying and wanting to have a conversation. I usually show them I am uninterested by replying with single words or expressing no emotion on my face until its awkward and they say goodbye. I cant connect with people at all on an emotional level is what I realized I don’t care about the persons dreams, desires, emotions or well-being for that matter. This may come across as very blunt and rude. But I don’t even care about my parents in the same manor I don’t care about other people. I don’t mind socializing so long as there is a clear goal (work or educational space). I don’t enjoy communicating with people for enjoyment. My lack of intimacy is probably a direct result of my disinterest with socializing with people. That being said feedback on this would be much appreciated.",My lack of intimacy is probably a direct result of my disinterest with socializing with people.,7

I was driving a road close to where i live and he popped into my head. The song playing had nothing to do with love, all of a sudden his truck passed by.

However, as I grew older and became more mature, I realized that how my mother acts was not normal for someone her age.

She also would not ask us for help directly, instead she would say something like ‘If only someone can help me do…’ or ‘We are eating so much today.

However, sometimes we would think of it as just a casual statement and my mother would start throwing a huge tantrum. Furthermore, my mother is really insensitive or ignorant about our feelings.

He speaks out of turn, has said mean things, and doesn’t really seem to care about authority or following the rules. (all of this is sometimes) Sometimes, he’s great. He tends to NOT be helpful or kind and is causing himself many issues. He’s had several school detentions for doing things such as name-calling or being disrespectful to his teachers. He is involved in scouting and loves it, but won’t listen to adult leaders or scout leaders. He’s had privileges taken away, and will now need to have his scouting experiences limited as he is not reliable in that setting. He doesn’t want his behaviors restricted but I can’t have him acting out everywhere. He is developing a reputation as kind of a jerk. His dad and I have divorced 5 years ago and he sees us both regularly and he also has a stepdad in his life that he cares about. All the parents are engaged to assist him in getting what he needs. I have a flexible work arrangement and am able to be home most days right after school gets out. I help with homework, we eat meals together–I’ve made a point to tell him in no uncertain terms that my love for him is unconditional. My other kid exhibits none of these behaviors. I’m at a loss.

He wandered off at a recent scout outing doing something that could have endangered himself and there will be consequences for that. So far, being grounded, having detentions, etc don’t really seem to matter to him. He gets really wound up and doesn’t listen and it feels like attention seeking behavior.

It wasn’t until then, that I began to notice more and really start to understand why I have never felt normal. I believe I have some kind of Anxiety and/or Depression problem. I have yet to see a professional, but I plan on it soon. As of right now, I’m looking for some uplifting advice to get me through until then. I’ve struggled with these issues my whole life. I’m just now realizing what it is and how it has affected me. As I go on in life, I’m struggling more than I should with who I am, and what to do.

244,"Been married about 10mth. We’ve known each other 10 years, mostly not together as he is from overseas. He moved to the US and we got married recently. Seemed a bit homesick and perhaps depressed after a few months, but that’s it. Recently he started not coming home. It started small. He was late from work or school, didn’t text or respond to texts or calls. Then he just wouldn’t come home until next day and wouldn’t say or would just say be home late and ignore any follow-up question. After the first few times, he explained that he was bored or unhappy and it just built up until it was just exploding. I told him that he could spend time with friends but he should have respect for me and keep me updated. After that he proceeded to stay away for 5 days, texting me daily that he would be home that night. He even apologized and proceeded to stay away another two days. He eventually came home but now we are in another week+ period. There has been no real explanation other than saying he is having fun, just an unreliable person, he wants to make sure it is clear in his mind before he explains it, and it has to do with us. The behavior has been extremely cruel, not explaining what is wrong and just giving the silent treatment. I could never imagine doing that to someone I love. He has done similar things in past but were not living together – they involved silent treatment that lasted a week until I could get him to explain – usually some kind of perceived idea about how I will react to something. He does not really communicate his feelings. He does not take criticism well. He makes few decisions and procrastinates. He is always late. He shows no anger. I asked him to go to our PCP but told him just a checkup re potential depression. He agreed, came home and he went to do laundry and never came back – without a coat in cold, later texting he felt I was pushing/controlling him. He said the problem was us-me (no detail) and cancel the appt. We are now at the point where he says he loves and misses me but is not ready to come home.

When I was in 8th grade I started looking at things on the internet that had to do with adult spanking. This led me to the domestic discipline sights that talk about spanking in a relationship. I became engrossed to say the least. I read all the DD stories. And decided that I couldn’t be in a relationship that did not include me getting a sound spanking when I deserved one… Also, another aspect that I think may be relevant is the fact that I have struggled with self injury off and on for 5 years.I was wondering if that somehow correlates with my spanking needs… but the real issue I guess is…is this a healthy expression?

A weirder example is when I got a second cat, I kept trying to convince my parents to give her away because I liked the dynamic of having one cat,it meant no favourites and the thought of things changing made me cry just thinking about it. This anxiety if change has always followed me. When i was younger Id have frequent dreams of finding out my mam was pregnant and Id wake up crying. Now this feeling has returned because my parents want to move and I just cant cope with the idea. I love my house, its ours and the thought of someone else living here and making it their home just makes me burst into tears.Another recent example was I had my first brief relationship which I ended just before we got together because I just couldn’t deal with it. He asked me out and I cried the whole walk home after saying yes,I did the same thing(crying)after he kissed me in the car ride home with my dad.

My bf changed his whole life to be with me, left his marriage and job, all his friends, and moved here and started a new career. The problem is it has now been over 3 years and he has not gotten divorced. He avoided his wife for over a year when she tried to start the divorce process and then she got cancer and stopped pursuing him for a divorce. He doesn’t have contact with her but he gets updates on her health from his mother, who still keeps in touch with her. We have lived together for over 2.5 years now and have gone many places and always take photos wherever we go. His public-facing social media profiles are pictures from when he was with his wife. And he has changed the pictures since he moved in with me, but still changed them to old pictures from his life with her. He has one small item of hers that holds a lot of sentimental value that she has asked him to return to her by mail and he told her he would but still hasn’t done so. He sees the item all the time and knows she wants it back but still doesn’t mail it to her. It feels like he’s fighting as hard as he can to avoid letting go completely.

1486,"I’m a 25 year-old male whose father and cousins have/had schizophrenia. I recently moved to Oregon, where marijuana is a legal drug, so I partake recreationally (3-4 times a week). I just started smoking marijuana when I was 24, and really didn’t make it a regular thing until I was 25. I’ve always had a slight fear of having schizophrenia, as I’ve studied mental illness since it’s been a very big part of my life. Recently, however, I feel those feelings have been slightly amplified due to the correlative nature between schizophrenia and marijuana usage displayed in medical and psychological studies. I’ve noticed myself becoming paranoid when under the influence (a common thing, I know). That paranoia usually subsides after I rest, along with the influence of the drug. That being said, I’ve been having some thoughts of being able to change the world. These thoughts occur heavily when I’m high, but also sometimes happen when I’m sober (only much less intense), and usually come in the form of being able to educate people about empathy and kindness (since I’m a teacher and an actor). I’ve also had moments where I try to empathize with people in order to understand what they’re thinking, and maybe even try to “read their thoughts” in order to better connect with them. Do I truly believe I can? No. But I do think I can come close to identify how their feeling in order to better help them with their problems. I can, somewhat frequently, also have quick mood changes into anger depending on circumstances; they usually happen when I’m driving or when I have a lot of stress in my life.","I’ve also had moments where I try to empathize with people in order to understand what they’re thinking, and maybe even try to “read their thoughts” in order to better connect with them.",8

The type of OCD that certain items ahve to be in the right place. I also do a lot of mental counting. Such as the fact that I have to do everything either 3,4,9,10+ (not 13) times. Everyday i have to do these counting and moving rituals although some days are worse than others. Some days i have no control but some days i have more control over them. Individually these rituals do not take long but when added toughener they take up about 30 minutes. It vary a lot by each day)(I have never really counted and so this is just a guess) of my day.

I must comment that i do feel as if i have a certain love towards dogs and often at times feel anxious and shy in social encounters.

I also have a strong urge to be in a position of power, always aiming to be in controll of people and their actions and to be ontop of social encounters, remaining one step ahead.

But…I really want to kill people, and I guess I think I probably shouldn’t. I have found some similar questions, but nothing that really answers my question. The main difference is that I don’t think I would really care on an emotional level if I killed anyone. The thought of actually going through with it doesn’t scare or distress me; quite the opposite, actually. I think it would be a lot of fun. The reason I think I shouldn’t is that I believe I would be more successful (whatever that means…) if I didn’t. Jail seems like a really boring place to be. I’ve felt bored for as long as I can remember. I like learning, or at least the idea of it, because I think having more information is good. Even learning is boring, though. I think it would be nice if it weren’t. Since I dislike being bored, and I imagine that jail would probably be even more boring that my life currently is, I’d rather not go to jail. There aren’t a lot of ways to research “killing without getting caught” so I figured I’d try to figure out how to not kill people instead. I’ve never actually killed anyone, if that matters. I’ve killed animals, and it was pretty nice, but never humans. I can’t quite describe why I want to kill. When I think about it, I feel like have a reason to live.

4517," I read a question that was similar to the one I have, but I did not believe it could fully be used for my situation. Both my girlfriend and me are 20 years of age. We have been together since July 2nd 2010, and it is March 28th 2011. We were friends for many years before we started dating but due to both of us moving around we were not able to have a relationship. She is everything I ever wanted in a woman and I am so happy to have her in my life. I had no sexual interactions what so ever before I was with her, she is my first in everything. Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. When she was growing up her parents neglected and even abused her. She was molested on several occasions, but never by a family member. Her life has not been one of happiness and is full of past pains that plague her to this day. She never felt loved or cared about by anyone, and sought out relationships to fill this void. Her first sexual experience was with a female, they were friends and one night during a sleep over her friend put her hand down my girlfriends pants and began feeling around down there. My girlfriend said she did it back to her friend. She was bisexual for a while and dated a few girls, but never did anything for that kiss them. Though not often she claims. Her first sexual experience with a boyfriend was when she was 14 and the guy she was dating asked her to “touch him”, and so she did. She says she didn’t want to but did it to make him happy. In her next relationship she let him suck on her breasts and finger her, she touched him but while he had pants on so there was no contact with his penis. In her third relationship she also let him finger her and she gave him a hand job as well. In her last relationship she went out with this guy for 2.5 years and she really loved him. He was the first she gave oral sex to, and they did everything together. He fingered her; she gave him many hand jobs and lots of oral sex. She wanted to have sex and so did he, but she brought it up to him. They agreed and she claims that he only penetrated her a little bit before finishing, so she doesn’t believe she lost her virginity. He claims that every time they tried, which both him and her say was 3 times, that they had full intercourse but she swears that after that first time having failed, and the other two times they never got past being naked, none of the times they ever had full intercourse. I don’t know if she’s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did, or if she really didn’t have full on sex with him. I know her was able to penetrate her at least somewhat so I also have issues with whether she was still a virgin the first time we had sex.","I don’t know if she’s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did, or if she really didn’t have full on sex with him.",8

He would rarely apologize, and seemed to be emotionally unavailable. Sometimes his withdrawal was due to me being upset about something that had nothing to do with him. He was extremely critical of my children, and my family.

However, it seemed no matter how I responded, he would find fault with it, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells when he was around because I never knew what would irritate him next.  In the past, I have tried to tell him how his actions made me feel, and how it affected me, but he responded with defensiveness and I ended up feeling worse, like everything was my fault. I felt like I was accepting any crumb of affection or attention from him even though I knew I wasn’t being treated right. I quit trying to talk to him about my hurt feelings because I feared it would just make him withdraw more, and possibly end the relationship. I’ve told him the situation was emotionally unhealthy for me, but I never confronted him about his actions being emotionally abusive. Now that the relationship has ended, I’m still struggling with all the hurtful things he did, and can’t seem to get past it. Should I confront him and tell him I think he was emotionally abusive and why? I’m afraid if I do, he’ll respond negatively and I’ll end up feeling worse, and if I don’t, it will continue to eat away at me, and I’ll regret not standing up for myself.

695,"So, I’ve noticed my mind isn’t exactly normal. There’s another entity in here that controls my imagination, sometimes subjects thoughts into my mind, and makes me paranoid and makes me feel impulsive at times. Sometimes if someone gets close to me it makes me want to punch the person and run off somewhere else. There’s someone in my head, but its not me. Used to, it had more control over me, but I’ve been able to realize that he doesn’t control me. He doesn’t know me. He doesn’t know anything. Used to he had me convinced I was Satan’s son, but I now realize that was a mad idea. even though I don’t listen to him, I still feel as though I am stalked.

1734,"My partner of many years had a childhood of abuse and abandonment. Eventually he was adopted and things improved to a degree. He’s never really dealt with his emotions about his past, although he is a sensitive guy and I know he has a lot of hurt inside him. He has instead chosen to repress and ignore these emotions. He moved across country, so his family is out of sight, out of mind. He will do anything to distract himself and not think about it. He definitely has shown signs of depression on and off over the years. I’ve suggested therapy to him before. It comes up perhaps once a year. He is extremely reluctant and he says has no desire to relive his terrible past. I’ve told him I understand that and that I think while therapy would be painful, I believe it would be worth it in the end. He’s extremely stubborn and pushing an issue will make him more likely to reject it, so I don’t bring this up often. My approach is to discuss it in a supportive manner, encourage help, not push it, leave it to germinate. It seems to have made him open up to the possibility of help. He has conceded in the past year that he might be depressed. We recently visited his adoptive parents. It had been 3-4 years since he had seen them, because they live back “home” and he’s been avoiding his past entirely. His foster father is very old and unwell. He put off seeing them as long as he could. I encouraged him to go visit, because the guilt at not going was evident and I knew he would have terrible regrets if his foster father died and he had not gone to see him in so long. I know he feels a lot of guilt for being so far from them, especially now they are old and unwell. He approached me today and stated he thinks he is depressed. I think this is a huge step for him to admit this. I want him to get the help he needs. I will of course, be supportive and will listen to anything he wants to talk about. I do strongly believe that therapy would be invaluable to him. How do I encourage this route without scaring him back into his shell?

1211,"When I was younger, I was only 12 and a half years old. I did something terrible to my younger sister, who was 5 years old during that time. I asked her if she wanted to do sexual activities. I also did not approach her by asking her in that way. When I was a really young child, I use to get in trouble by my parents from touching myself. Where that was when my parents used this word to describe my action in a different language. Therefore, that was how I approached my sister on asking her. I have posted in other forums on different websites like Yahoo and PsychForum. They stated that it was a form of molestation or sexual assault. I did ask her for consent. However, thinking about it now, I don’t think it counts — she was only 5 years old. I really do think it was a form of molestation.

2552,"Since I can remember, I’ve always thought of myself as unattractive. At school I was considered undesirable and teased indirectly about my looks. In my later teens men started taking an interest and I became sexually active and happy, eventually entering my first relationship which lasted 4 years. This relationship ended about a year ago and though I am over it, my ex dragged out the ending and it became quite bitter with another woman involved. He would openly compare me to her and make comparisons and refused to kiss me but also would not end the relationship and have very unemotional sex with me – as though I were an object. He began making direct comments about my lack of attractiveness and eventually I left. A month or so after that, I slept with one man after a date in a dark room. Since then, I have been unable to be naked around myself or others. I cannot look at myself in the mirror and my sex life has completely stopped as I can’t be intimate unless the room is pitch black, I have clothes on and I don’t know the guy. It’s been almost a year since I last had any sexual contact with anyone and it’s upsetting me greatly. I worry I won’t ever be able to be naked or intimate with anyone again. The problem has progressed – I have always been nervous of spending time with just one person unless I know them extremely well as I fear awkward silences or general awkwardness. This has merged with my inability to have sex as I also fear being alone with someone I intend to have sex with: what would I say? What do we talk about? What if there is nothing to talk about? I miss being intimate with others and there have been multiple times I could have engaged in sexual activity or perhaps formed a relationship on one occasion but I can’t discuss this issue with anyone other than close friends and the distress it causes me knowing I won’t be able to have sex leads me to push potential sexual partners away. I decided to seek help on here after tonight, 2 separate men I know I can speak to alone, came to my room to ask if I’d like to sleep with them and both times I panicked and was unable.

They didn’t get that mad but told me I couldn’t play it anymore. The problem is that now that I never play it anymore I feel a very strong need to play it and since no other game can replace it I feel unhappy and unfulfilled. When I actually write it out the first time it sounds really pathetic but it’s actually quite a big problem. I wasn’t very happy with my life before but video games was an easy way to cope with other things (when I say cope I don’t mean through extreme violence like in GTA’s case, more like a person who really likes soccer and uses that). The reason my parents won’t let me play it is because of the mature content but I’m not interested in the sex and drugs and the violence is unrealistic enough not to affect me at all. To be honest I don’t really feel anything special when for example killing people in video games. I’ve done a lot of research and I like to think that I know more than most people about psychology and I’m very sure that I’m not a psychopath nor narcissist. An example from the game is this one scene involving torture which I found pretty hard to get through. I’m also quite intelligent for my age and has scored 121 on an IQ test, I’ve also got really good grades and stuff so I think that that’s maybe why I’m not affected by violence I know is fake. I’ve also already done pretty much everything in the game and seen almost everything in it in movies and tv series, so I kinda feel like I’ve seen everything and that all potential damage is already done. My parents have also said that you shouldn’t take chances and that I may get affected even though I didn’t before. That may be but I’ve actually begun to feel really depressed and sad most of the time and I know that there’s no other way to fix it.

I thought that people were trying to poison me, I feared that family members were going to kill me. I was aware that these thoughts were illogical, but I couldn’t shake the fear that they caused me. I would get panic attacks thinking that I drank from a poisoned water fountain.

I refused to eat this one because I assumed some reverse psychology was being pulled and the ones without the rips were fine.

Ive been with my boyfriend for 3 years now, and before we got together, he warned me that before we had intercourse, not to be ‘alarmed’ if he didnt come as he said it usually takes him several hours to do so.

I have a very high sex drive and it has got to the point that he can not be bothered to have sex as it “takes too long”.

I actually broke down and hid a video camera outside. It recorded her climbing in our bedroom window with my ex’s help. She did this while I was downstairs making dinner.

1501," Hi! I’m a young teen, and I have depression, that I suppose is kinda severe, General and Social anxiety. Around 2 years ago I was put on anti depressants, which have worked pretty well. Around a year ago, I abruptly stopped taking them without really telling anyone. I’m not really sure why, but I did. This was around the holidays, and I was on vacation with family friends in a vacation house owned by some of their relatives. Now, it was a beach house, and, being the middle of winter and family meant that it had not been cleaned beforehand. I was originally sleeping with my friend, but moved to my mom’s bed. My father passed away when I was 9, which caused some underlying anxiety to get worse, along with the typical grief and depression. I slept ok for the first night, but on the second night, I could not relax. It was storming, and an outside swinging door was banging on the wall. This put me on edge. There was one or two old stains on the sheets, and because of that, I started picturing bed bugs or whatever in the bed. (Not hallucinating, just imagining). I then started to get the “bugs crawling on you” feeling, and started sobbing and babbling nonsense. I tend to do that when I get panicked. After around 15 or so minutes, my mom gave me my prescribed lorazapram, and I calmed down and went to sleep. The worst part was when I was on the 5 or so hour drive home. We have a minivan, and I like to sit in the way back to have more space to spread out. My younger sister, 9 at the time, was sitting in front of me. I’m not sure how it started, but for what seemed like most of the drive, I was having a panic attack. But it was different. I also was hitting my sister, hard enough to hurt her, screaming nonsense, and basically having a tantrum. We live in a historical area, and while we passed signs for places I had been, I started yelling at my mom to go to the places. I really have no clue why. It was horrible.

I got it in my head that this is the one thing you are good at, don’t ever lose or let them see you fail.

285,"I have been trying to figure out what’s the matter with me for the last 3 years. I was first diagnosed with depression and tried a bunch of SSRIs that had no good or bad effect on me. I then did a sleep study and was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. I was put on modafinil and it helped a little bit but eventually wore off and now I’m on armodafinil which has even less of an effect than modafinil did. The doc also prescribed Lexapro (which i’ve been on before) with the armodafinil and this time around it made me feel kind of depressed. The doctor took me off of it (this is a sleep doctor by the way) and explained that since I had a bad reaction to the Lexapro that i may have Bi-polar Depression. I don’t fit the signs of this but upon trying to relate to this condition I stumbled upon ADHD symptoms, how it is confused with depression, and how it can go undetected. The symptoms of ADHD fit me like a glove. I am forgetful, I lose things to an extreme that it disrupts my life. I have had anxiety since I was a child, I’m restless, impulsive, impatient, I have very bad fidgeting and nail-biting habits, I zone out on conversations, I have had drug and alcohol addictions in the past, I drink coffee all day and all night long, and my husband is put through hell trying to keep up with and clean up my messes, I even have to keep my cards and ID in his wallet so that I don’t lose them.

255,"When I was 14-17, I lived with a physically and verbally abusive step-father who constantly insinuated that I was gay. I didn’t know how to stand up for myself then. I remember a particular night, waking and feeling barely aware, as if I’d been drugged, and unable to move. I actually don’t know if this is, in fact, a memory or if it was a nightmare, but it was very realistic. I was in my room, in my bed, and every detail about the room is there. I distinctly remember seeing the hallway light and this man my mother was married to standing at the door. He comes into the room and forces oral sex on me. All I remember is gasping for air and being unable to move my arms. To this day, 18 years later, I’m not sure if this experience was just an awful nightmare or if it is a memory. During this time, I also began suffering from sleep apnea and have had trouble sleeping since then. My life has generally been stressful since those years for various reasons. For example, I learned last year that I have seizures in my sleep (in addition to the daytime ones that began 10 years ago). I’ve done pretty good at not letting myself feel like a victim, especially since I have confusion regarding the past. But I have always wondered if I was drugged and raped as a minor. And if this is why my life has been stressful, why I seem to lack self-confidence, why I developed epilepsy and sleep issues. I don’t know how to feel about it. Should I try to unlock any buried memories? Should I just shrug and bury the whole thing, move forward and all that? Will any of this help me better address the stresses I have? How important is it to resolve this? I am being treated for both the apnea and the epilepsy.","But I have always wondered if I was drugged and raped as a minor.

During my childhood, my grandma would tell me horrible things about my father such as that he abandoned me, that he doesn’t care about me, etc. which resulted in me not having any kind of relationship with my father up until my late teen years when we started rebuilding it. He and my mother don’t talk and she is convinced that my father wants to turn me against her and this is the reason for many terrible arguments I am having with her which sometimes end in her issuing an ultimatum- either I’ll act the way she wants me to or I can pack my bags and move to my dad’s place. She also claims that I don’t love her or care about her and that I will always prefer my father over her which is not true because for my whole life I wanted them to get along and respect each other. On the other hand, my dad won’t visit me at my place because he could run into my mom since I am living with her. He does hate my mom for all the thing she did to him in the past and is avoiding her completely while she blames him for everything bad that happened to her. Recently my mom started seeing a neuropsychiatrist who diagnosed her with depression and anxiety. Because of that I sometimes avoid certain topics for discussion because I’m afraid she would judge me or get angry with me.

597,"In the recent months, my mother and my father had a fight. Which ended in my father wanting to leave, but he didn’t because my mom begged him to stay. She told us that, and we (her children ) supposedly don’t know they fought. But as the months have gone by she has completely crumbled. She has many breakdowns on weekends when my father goes out. When she has these breakdowns, she talks in a really suicidal way. She tells us how she wants to die, how she feels guilty, how she wants things to go back, how she really just wants to disappear. She acts this way because since they fought, my father completely neglected my mom. He told her that she can’t love her anymore and that he can’t forgive her. So coming back to her breakdowns, it is really worrying to see her in that state, in which she cries for hours and hours until she calms down. As her children, who are young we can’t really do anything for her other than give her a shoulder. But it has gotten to a point where she cries whenever she is alone. We don’t know what to do anymore, because she has stopped eating or resting. My father’s harsh words towards her really don’t help her, because she still hopes he might love her one day.

1893,"My name is S—-, and I’m 19 years old. For most of my life, I’ve been experiencing urges to kill people. And not with guns or anything like that either. I want to slice them open with a knife, taste their raw flesh, and watch the light leave their eyes as they die. If people on the street knew what I was thinking about doing to them, then they’d probably be horrified. Fantasizing about this sort of of thing really arouses me sexually, and while it’s not the only thing that does, it’s possibly the best. These urges don’t only occur when I’m upset or angered, but those emotions definitely amplify them. For example, if I’m just standing there with something sharp in my hand, I’ll have the impulse to just thrust it into the soft throat of the nearest person. I would just love to feel it sink in, and get covered by the blood gushing from their wound. I’d probably cannibalize their body, too, because I love the smell and taste of blood. When I was younger, I would cut my arms just to taste the blood and rub it on my face. I’ve never actually killed anyone, no matter how much I’ve wanted to, but I a did stab my neighbor’s dog to death once. It just made me feel so alive, like nothing else ever had, to feel it’s fear and watch it die. Now that I’m writing this all down, it’s making me sound like some kind of deformed, basement-dwelling freak. But I’m an attractive person, have a sizable amount of friends, loving parents, and a beautiful girlfriend. She’s the real reason I’m writing this; I’m absolutely horrified by the prospect of her finding out what I’m like. I don’t want her to be afraid of me, but she’s too sweet to not be. I haven’t “gotten help” yet because I’m still living off of my parents, and I haven’t even told them I’m a lesbian yet, much less a psychotic cannibal. I just can’t see that conversation going well. I’ve also often fantasized about stabbing a therapist in the eye with his own pen, so I don’t know if that would be such a good idea.

This means that instead of it just being obvious to my mum that I need help, I’m faced with the terrifying task of confessing my feelings to her. My mum and I are not friends, she is my parent and I am her child. This doesn’t necessarily mean we’re not close, but it does mean I have never found it easy to open up to her like I would a close friend. I find it difficult to articulate my thoughts alone, but to explain it to her seems almost impossible. I’m not sure where to begin. I have no one else to turn to as my father is not included in my life, it is just me and her in our household and I don’t have any other adults I trust with this sort of thing.","I find it difficult to articulate my thoughts alone, but to explain it to her seems almost impossible.",7
1604,"I have almost always had minor visual hallucinations (dark figures, geometric patterns, stationary objects look like they’re moving) in the dark (nighttime, dark room, anywhere), deep troubles identifying whether a memory is from real life or a dream, and I get deja vu a few times a week. I did not until recently realize that these could be symptoms of something concerning developing even though the hallucinations always make me very frightened/paranoid. A few years ago auditory hallucinations (muted conversations, can’t distinguish any words) developed. I have never taken any illegal/prescription drugs that could cause hallucinations. Is this simply my adhd causing memory problems and getting bored, or should I be looking into something else? (I should also mention that I suspect that I have borderline personality disorder due to emotional neglect/abuse from my parents and suddenly 4 years ago all my friends (known them for 7+ years) abandoned me. I have little sense of identity, fear of abandonment, frequent and intense mood swings, and splitting on people. However my hallucinations and confused memories are not about any of the traumatic events so I think it is something separate.)",(I should also mention that I suspect that I have borderline personality disorder due to emotional neglect/abuse from my parents and suddenly 4 years ago all my friends (known them for 7+ years) abandoned me.,7
1548,"So for at least a year I’ve had many situations where I feel for instance that cameras are hidden all around my house and that people are watching and listening to me. While I feel like that I try to tell myself that that’s probably not happening (because I have looked and not found any cameras) but I still feel like it is. (I have thoughts like that at least once a day.) another example of what is happening is I have a feeling most of my friends are secretly trying to hurt me and my reputation when that doesn’t make sense. I have tried to confront my friends, they denied it but a part of me thinks if they actually are conspiring against me then that is exactly what they would say. Something else that might be related (I’m not sure) is that I don’t really speak to anyone at school after I confronted my friends (I used to speak to people) I am just not very interested in talking to people who are out to get me. Do you think what I am experiencing are delusions or just a normal bit of paranoia? *note* i have done some evaluation for schizophrenia and am not schizophrenic.","I have tried to confront my friends, they denied it but a part of me thinks if they actually are conspiring against me then that is exactly what they would say.",8
1657," From the U.S.: I know you do not diagnose, but just wondering what you think. My grandson turned three. He is a fraternal twin. The other twin is a girl. He is extremely aggressive and has poor impulse control, throws toys or anything really. Many times he throws hard toys right at his sister’s little head! He’s been described as a bully at daycare. In fact, he has been in some fights with other boys!",,2
1608,"I really don’t know what to do. My daughter is 14. It all started when she got her first phone at 12 when we caught her sending pictures she had no business sending. So the phone was taken away. Her grades started slipping and she was without her phone for about a year. Now she is a freshman in high school, since she plays for the school Softball team I was hoping she’d straighten out so she can play. But that’s not the case.",,2

2316,"My Dad and I usually get on quite well. We have a lot in common, but whenever he cooks or cleans he doesn’t do the job properly. For instance, he won’t wash his hands before cooking or clean the sides down properly. I’m generally not that bothered by germs but everyone knows the basics of hygiene in the kitchen. I try to tell him that he should wash his hands, but he just get annoyed, and makes some excuse like he’s ‘thinking about other things’. 9 times out of 10 he doesn’t do the washing up properly either eg. there will still be oil on the frying pan. So when I try to do it or I tell him that it’s unclean he just gets irritated and says “your being rather annoying now” when I’m just trying to makes sure my sister and I get a healthy meal in a clean kitchen. My mum usually makes sure that the kitchen and everything else is clean but she’s away seeing her parents because my grandma’s going into surgery soon. Now my dad’s left with us he just seems incapable of doing even basic chores. I can’t keep pestering him but he doesn’t learn. It could be that he listens to my mum or that she does it usually and dad hasn’t had to do the washing up more than once every few days. I think it’s a bit of both.",My Dad and I usually get on quite well. ,9
1051,"I am alone on a daily basis since I can remember, at one and a half years old I got a nanny so both my parents could work. I always stayed in kindergarden and elementary school until 5 or 6 pm, my only friend was my older sister and there the friendship came almost only from my side, because she had friends of her own and I was a bother. In 6th grade people first started talking to me, and I didn’t know what to do or how to react to the things they did, I am still not sure sometimes. I first started paying attention to the people around me. Everyone else was intense to me, I didn’t know what to do when they were in a certain mood. I am not even sure how to handle the emotions of my sister. When someone cried, others came to them, they worried and tried to comfort them. I could look at the crying kid as long as I wanted, I didn’t really feel anything. But it is not like I didnt feel anything. I am pretty sure I feel as much as everyone else, just at the wrong place and wrong time. I don’t talk with my parents about it, I think I bother them. I would like to talk to someone about it, but I wouldn’t know what to say. I just feel out of place. When people actually talk to me, which almost never happens, I don’t know what they actually want from me, even if they perfectly articulate themselves. I never had enough experience with, well, people to know how to comfort someone, to calm someone down, to lead a conversation. I am partly afraid to do the wrong thing, say something wrong, gesturing wrong, act out of place as ever. Also I just have no clue what to do. As I already said, I am pretty sure I have as many emotions as everyone else. I feel numb on a regular basis, but I think everyone has that. But I have a problem with showing emotion, I don’t show what I feel and I have a blank face for almost all the time. I do it subconsciously and only found out because someone asked me about it. I would like to be like everyone else, but I don’t know what is wrong either.

1021,"My life is currently a disaster. I understand other people have it worse. Physically, I am blessed. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, transportation, a supportive family, an amazing church, and a helpful therapist (who is both a mental health counselor as well as a drug and alcohol counselor) who truly seems to care. During a very recent hospitalization, I also began utilizing a journal to get my thoughts out in a private manner. I have an incredible support system I rarely utilize. I am struggling with a number of issues. I suck at reaching out before making terrible decisions such as self harm and drug use. I am an alcoholic and a drug addict who attends AA meetings regularly but have yet to pick up my 24-hour chip. I feel as if I’m not ready to surrender and work a program. I am, however, terrified of the consequences of alcoholism/drug use. Another fellowship I was previously a member of states these consequences at the start of every meeting: jails, institutions, and death. I lost one of my best friends in March to addiction. I have also seen many others lose their lives. While heroin is not my DOC, I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence. I am in such a conundrum. That is the only word I can think of to describe this mess known as my life. Following the worst inpatient experience of my life, I am also struggling with the emotional pain of being on a very small amount of numerous medications. I am on the starting doses of these meds which have not nearly reached a therapeutic level. I feel as though I am mentally and emotionally unstable, as is proven by my recent words and actions towards others. This has caused others pull away, possibly permanently. I owe amends I’m not ready to give. As a member of AA, I believe in the ninth step. That is a step I struggled with a lot, though. There were a lot of repeated amends by mouth, but no changed behavior. It was unintentional lip service. I was and still am unsure of how to change my behavior. My next issue has to do with the job I just lost on Monday and the rest of the issues I haven’t discussed that were a result of this volcano that has just erupted. A few weeks ago, I put my two weeks notice in at a job I had worked at for three weeks shy of a year. I was burned out on working with the general public, so going back is not an option. I had just been offered a contracted cleaning job. So for my last two weeks of work at my old job, I worked both jobs. This was not a good decision. I was simultaneously feeling suicidal due to just being put on Latuda. I could not get ahold of my psychiatrist, so after just two weeks of working a brand new job, i found it necessary to go inpatient before I made a fatal decision. Following being inpatient, they told me at my new job that while I had been out of work for two weeks, they had to fill my position. I burned bridges, lost my sponsor as a result of using the day they let me go, and cut myself for the first time in two years. I feel too unstable to try to obtain and maintain employment at this time. I will not be able to pass a drug test at the moment. Not having a job leaves me with a ton of time on my hands. I am torn between applying for SSI and SSD and looking for a new job (in a few weeks.) This leaves me with no income. I am blessed to live with a parent who provides for me. I don’t really understand the point of sharing all of this. I am the one who needs to make some changes and decisions.","While heroin is not my DOC, I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence.
